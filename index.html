        <h3>Conversational AI for Vocabulary Development and Educational Equity</h3>
        <p>Vocabulary knowledge is the single best predictor of reading achievement and school completion. Young children vary in their vocabulary knowledge before the first day of kindergarten due to sociodemographic and developmental factors. Traditional educational approaches have failed to close these gaps, perhaps because they do not adapt to children's individual knowledge in a scalable fashion. We are developing and piloting a speech-based AI avatar designed to deliver tailored educational content in real-time. This avatar utilizes advanced NLP to engage children in interactive vocabulary teaching, adapting its responses to each child's progress. This platform is grounded in robust scientific research on how children learn language and is adapted from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the lab, which demonstrated its effectiveness in supporting children’s vocabulary learning (Ozernov-Palchik, Olson, et al., 2023; Olson, Ozernov-Palchik et al., under review).</p>

        <h3>Neurocognitive Basis of Reading Comprehension in Children with/without Dyslexia</h3>
        <p>Developmental dyslexia affects 10-12% of all children and is a deficit in accurate or fluent word decoding. Many children with dyslexia continue to struggle with reading comprehension, the overall goal of reading, even after their decoding skills have been normalized, but little is known about the neurocognitive basis of impaired comprehension in dyslexia. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral measures, this project investigates the components of reading comprehension in children with dyslexia in second and third grade, the earliest point at which dyslexia can be reliably identified. Our first paper from this project investigated the developmental trajectory of language lateralization, demonstrating that the language system is already left-lateralized by age 4, using cutting-edge fMRI approaches on large-scale datasets, and challenges the view that the language system is initially bilateral during early development.</p>

        <h3>Domain-Specific and General Learning Processes in Literacy Development and Dyslexia</h3>
        <p>This research focuses on understanding the learning mechanisms that support literacy development and the specific deficits that contribute to phonological impairments in developmental dyslexia. While individuals with developmental dyslexia exhibit broader perceptual deficits in the auditory domain, their implicit learning deficits are particularly pronounced in the linguistic domain, such as in speech perception. My work, using psycholinguistic, procedural learning, and statistical learning experiments, reveals that individuals with dyslexia struggle with speech-specific perceptual adaptation and exhibit impaired neural representation of speech sounds. However, these deficits do not extend to non-linguistic auditory processing, such as tones. Interestingly, despite these challenges, individuals with dyslexia often achieve typical oral language, pointing to domain-specific learning abilities.</p>

        <h3>Preventing Reading Failure Using Speech Recognition and Machine Learning Technologies</h3>
        <p>Early identification of reading difficulties is essential for effective intervention, but current kindergarten screening methods focused on speech rather than reading are limited in scalability and specificity. This project aims to create an open database with annotated speech samples from kindergartners to predict future reading outcomes. By leveraging speech recognition technology and hosting crowdsourcing competitions, we will develop tools to automatically score speech outputs and predict which children are at risk for reading difficulties, providing early support. Our goal is to significantly reduce false positives in identifying at-risk children. Additional focus on this project is on applying advanced machine learning methods to analyze large dyslexia datasets and survey data to identify factors that determine the timing and accuracy of risk and reading disability diagnosis.</p>
